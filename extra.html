				<h1>Project Battlestar (1.3.1): For this project we created a space invaders inspired game, where the user has to move their plane with arrow keys and shoot missiles with the spacebar towards moving enemy targets. Furthermore, we also included a timer and a scoreboard/leaderboard features to create competition between users. We used all the loops required within the performance task requirements for our features and incorporated color and movement throughout. Personally, I liked this concept the most out of the projects I have created so far for this class and it's sucess motivated us to keep adding more features.</h1>
